# Coding_Journey
Week 1: 
Input Output was assigned to me on week 2. 

The Problem: Assume there is a family of four, and each pizza box consists of eight slices. Design one program to calculate how many boxes of pizza are needed if each member has the same number of slices, and design the second program to ask how many boxes of pizza are necessary if each member wants a different number of slices. 

Learned: This lesson taught me how to ask the user for data and execute essential mathematical functions.

WEEK 2: 
Decision Structures was assigned to my class on week 2. 

The Problem: Create a program comparing the time it takes for an average driver to travel on the road (the user gives mph) to the user’s speed (assumed to be higher than the speed limit). 

Learned: This assignment taught me how to use IF functions and to create different conditional statements within my code.

WEEK 3: 
Loops was assigned to my class on week 3. 

The Problem: Design a program that subtracts the user’s input from the store’s inventory (string) and then calculates the number of muffins and cupcakes remaining. 

Learned: In this assignment, I learned how to deduct the amount of inventory using the user’s response as a string and not an actual variable during a loop function.

WEEK 4: 
Hours & Minutes Week was assigned to my class in week 4. 

The Problem: asks the user to enter the number of hours and minutes for an activity. 

Learned: I learned how to define my conditional statements more and how to end the program when the statements meet certain conditions.
